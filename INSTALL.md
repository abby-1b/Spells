# Installation instructions

Important: This is a Linux/MacOS only library. The installer will not work on Windows systems!

First, make sure you've got [Deno installed](https://deno.land/manual@v1.31.1/getting_started/installation):
```
deno --version
```

Then, run the install utility, which doesn't exist yet. For now, just clone the repo and follow the steps below...

# If you've already cloned the repository
Run the following to install the library:
```
sudo deno run -A install.ts
```

Keep in mind that moving the cloned repo anywhere will break the executable's functioning.
